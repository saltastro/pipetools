FILES AFTER HRS DATA PIPELINE with MIDAS:

The following files were reduced using MIDAS pipeline:
m*_[12]w.fits - extracted first(1) and second (2) fibers.
	     Wavelength calibrated (uniform step). Not merged.
	     2D spectrum, where each order is one line in 2D spectrum.
	     This is the most compact format, but only MIDAS can understand
	     it easily.

m*_[12]we.fits - extracted first(1) and second(2) fibers, but each order
	     is written as separate FITS extension. FITS file has as many
	     extensions as extracted orders. Can be easily understand by IRAF.
	     NOT corrected for the blaze effect.

m*_[12]wm.fits - extracted fibers, wavelength calibrated and merged.
	     Simple 1D FITS spectrum. Both MIDAS and IRAF understand it.
	     NOT corrected for the blaze effect.

m*_u[12]w.fits - extracted fibers, corrected for the blaze effect.
	     Wavelength calibrated (uniform step). Not merged.
	     2D spectrum, where each order is one line in 2D spectrum.
	     This is the most compact format, but only MIDAS can understand
	     it easily.

m*_u[12]we.fits - extracted fibers, corrected for the blaze effect.
	     Wavelength calibrated (uniform step). Not merged.
	     Each order is written as separate FITS extension.
	     FITS file has as many extensions as extracted orders.
	     Can be easily understand by IRAF.

m*_[12]wm.fits - extracted fibers, corrected for the blaze effect,
	     wavelength calibrated (uniform step) and merged.
	     Simple 1D FITS spectrum. Both MIDAS and IRAF understand it.

m*_wm.fits - the final result after sky fiber was subtracted.
	     Simple 1D FITS spectrum. Both MIDAS and IRAF understand it.
